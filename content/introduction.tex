\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Prior Work}

Guo et al. \cite{Guo22}, who presented two intersection-recovery attacks 
against the Private Set Intersection Cardinality (PSI-CA) and Private Set Intersection Sum (PSI-SUM) functionalities.
This was followed up in 2024 by Jiang et al. \cite{AnonPSI} with more proposals of attacks 
against the same functionalities,
some of which improve on Guo et al.'s and some of which are new. Most recently, Falzon and Tang \cite{U:FalTan25} proposed a series of attacks against Google's Private Join and Compute (PCJ) functionality~\cite{PJC}, which takes as input two key-value stores and computes the inner product of the values whose keys lie in the intersection. 
They use a variety of techniques including combinatorial approaches, maximum likelihood estimation and techniques borrowed from signal processing.
