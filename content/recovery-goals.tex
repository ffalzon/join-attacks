\section{Threat Model and Recovery Goals}
\label{sec:recovery-goals}

\subsection{Threat Model}
Throughout this work, we assume that $P_1$ is adversarial (we denote the corrupted party by $\tP_1$) and $P_2$ is an honest party holding a fixed set $Y$ that the adversary wishes to learn about. We call set $Y$ the \textbf{recovery set}. $\tP_1$ follows the protocol specification honestly but may adaptively choose and modify its inputs and invoke the functionality an arbitrary number of times, while $P_2$ behaves honestly with a static input.

The adversarial party $\tP_1$ holds a \textbf{target set} $T$ and aims to infer as much information as possible about $Y$ relative to $T$. The exact objective depends on the functionality as described below.


\subsection{Recovery Goal Against $\calF_{\PSU}$ and $\calF_{\PSUCA}$}\label{sec:IR_goal}

The goal of private set union (PSU) is to hide the intersection of the input sets~\cite{USENIX:JSZG24}. The natural recovery goal for attacks against PSU and PSU-CA is to thus recover this intersection.

\begin{definition}
	Let $T$ be the target set and $Y$ be the recovery set. An adversary $\adv$ achieves \textbf{intersection recovery} if it outputs $T \cap Y$.
\end{definition}

Recovering the intersection is a goal that was also consisdered by attacks against PSI-related functionalities e.g.,~\cite{USENIX:GHLWJL22,NDSS:JiaDuYan24}.


\subsection{Recovery Goal Against $\calF_{\MKPM}$}\label{sec:MRR_goal}

Given that the $\calF_{\MKPM}$ functionality operates on sets of records, a natural recovery goal would be to recover the set of records appearing in both input sets. However, exact matches between records are unlikely in real-world scenarios. We thus adapt the intersection recovery goal to the multi-key setting.

The matching logic in MK-PrivateID (see Figure~\ref{fig:match_logic} for a definition and Figure~\ref{fig:matching-logic-example} for an example) assigns the same UID to matched pairs of records and distinct UIDs to unmatched ones. One can think of $\match$ as computing a pseudo-union of records, where a record in the target set and one in the recovery set are considered ``equal'' if they are assigned the same UID. A natural generalization of set intersection is to recover the records in the adversary’s target set that are matched with some record in the recovery set. However, because $T$ and $Y$ are shuffled prior to matching, identical inputs across different executions are not consistently paired, and even the number of matches may vary.


We thus relax our recovery goal to include all records in the target set that share at least one identifier with a record in the recovery set. Such records, which could \emph{potentially} be matched by the protocol logic, are referred to as \textbf{matchable records}. We formalize this notion as follows:
\[
    T \sqcap Y := \{\bt \in T \setdsc \exists \by \in Y,\ \exists j, \ell \in \NN \text{ s.t. } \bt[j] = \by[\ell]\}
\]
For an example, consider the input sets depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:matching-logic-example}. Here $X\sqcap Y = X$ since both records in $X$ share an identifier with some record in $Y$.

Unlike standard set intersection, $T \sqcap Y$ is not commutative. In particular, $T \sqcap Y$ is a subset of $T$, but not necessarily a subset of $Y$. We adopt the recovery of the matchable records as the attack goal in our analysis of the $\mathcal F_{\MKPM}$ functionality (without leakage).


\begin{definition}\label{def:matchable_records_recovery}
	Let $T$ be the target set of records and $Y$ be the recovery set of records.
	An adversary $\adv$
	achieves \textbf{matchable record recovery (MRR)} if it outputs $T\sqcap Y$.
\end{definition}

Note that MRR does not require the adversary to reconstruct identifiers or records in $Y$. Nevertheless, this information is sensitive and should not be recoverable, since simply knowing that an identifier from a user appears in another organization's dataset can compromise the privacy of that user. Furthermore, in the original paper~\cite{MKPMC}, specific precautions against leaking this information are emphasized in the protocol design.


\subsection{Recovery Goal Against $\calF_{\LMKPM}$}\label{sec:MR_goal}

We now consider a stronger recovery goal when given access to the \emph{leaky} MKPM functionality $\mathcal F_{\LMKPM}$: identifying all identifiers in the target set that also occur in the victim’s set. This represents the maximum amount of plaintext information an adversary can obtain about $Y$ using only $\tilde{P}_1$’s output of $\mathcal F_{\mathrm{LMKPM}}$. The adversary aims to reconstruct all records in $Y$ that contain at least one identifier from~$T$. Notably, since
$\mathcal F_{\LMKPM}$ outputs to~$\tilde{P}_1$ a local map~$\MX$ from UIDs to matched records, the maximum plaintext inference possible from the output alone is the recovery of the identifiers in $\tilde{P}_1$’s set.

\begin{definition}\label{def:max_recons}
	Let $T$ be the target set of records and $Y$ be the recovery set of records. An adversary $\adv$ achieves \textbf{maximum set reconstruction (MSR)} of $Y$ w.r.t. $T$ if it outputs a multiset $R_Y$ for which there exists an injective mapping $\varphi : R_Y \to Y$ such that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For all $\by^* \in R_Y$ and all $\id \in \by^*$ we have $\id \in \varphi(\by^*)$.
		\item For all $\by^* \in R_Y$ 
		and all $\id \in\varphi(\by^*)$ we have if $\id \in \Ispace{T}$ 
		then $\id \in \by^*$.
		\item For all $\by \in Y$, if there is some $\id \in \by$ 
		with $\id \in \Ispace{T}$ then $\by \in \varphi\left(R_Y\right)$. 
	\end{enumerate} 
\end{definition}

See Figure~\ref{fig:maximum-reconstruction-example} for an illustration.

Injectivity of $\varphi$ ensures that each $\by^* \in R_Y$ corresponds to exactly one $\by \in Y$.
Condition~(1) enforces per-record soundness, i.e., every identifier in a reconstructed record
appears in the corresponding original record.
Condition~(2) captures $\Ispace{T}$-restricted per-record completeness i.e., each reconstructed record contains all identifiers from its original record that also appear in $\Ispace{T}$.
Finally, Condition~(3) enforces $\Ispace{T}$-restricted global completeness i.e., all records
containing an identifier from $\Ispace{T}$ are at least partially reconstructed.
